## Notes On Individual Games

### I Was A Teenage Exocolonist

I was initially surprised by this one. I knew it would be top 10, but was it really better than FFX or Morrowind? Yes -
yes it is. In 2023, as a grown-ass adult in my 30s, this game kept me playing until after for the first, second, and
third time since high school.

### Dota 2

I considered placing this lower or not including it at all, because any long-time dota player's feelings about the game
are... _complicated_. But with 15,000 play hours across nearly 11,000 matches (at time of writing), my revealed
preference is clear.

### Final Fantasy X

My girlfriend recently played through FFX for the first time, giving me a chance to re-evaluate the game over 20 years
after it initially released. With the benefit of an extra two decades playing games (and one decade of software
engineering experience), I have gained a new appreciation for the smoothness of the game balance and progression. A new
player with no experience with this kind of game was able to complete the game without grinding (sans the Mt. Gagazet
Seymour fight) with every boss fight providing a reasonable degree of challenge.

### Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons

This game is the single most striking example of ludo-narrative harmony that exists.

### Baldur's Gate 3

I honestly expected this to be higher on the list. By all rights, it really ought to be higher than Divinity: Original
Sin 2 since this is a refinement of the same formula by the same studio, but on reflection I have realized that the D&D
license detracts from the game relative to its predecessors for me. There is much less exploration of the world and lore
available to me because I am already familiar with the D&D world.

### Outer Wilds

This game set a new floor in narrative exploration.

## Games to Reconsider

A few games in this list were clearly filters relative to their surrounding games, and so might need to be placed higher
when reconsidering them next year.

* Final Fantasy IX
* Sid Meier's Civilization VI
* The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion
* Slay the Spire
* Little Inferno
* Into the Breach
* Opus Magnum
* FTL
